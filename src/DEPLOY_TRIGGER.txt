# Latest Performance Metrics:
# - Local engine: Sandy Alcantara (1.138) vs Erick Fedde (1.156) 
# - Realistic run totals: 4.7-5.0 (not 12+ like on current site)
# - Speed: 21.6ms average
# - MLB accuracy: 9.01 vs 8.86 target (1.7% error)

# Issue on onrender site:
# - All pitcher factors showing 1.000 (should be 0.862-1.156 range)
# - High run totals ~12+ (should be 8-9 range)
# - Using old engine without real game data integration

# This file triggers redeploy with correct engine
