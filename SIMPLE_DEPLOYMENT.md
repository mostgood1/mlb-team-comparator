# Alternative: Simple Branch Deployment

If GitHub Actions isn't working, use this simpler approach:

## Steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/mostgood1/mlb-team-comparator/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Click Save

The site will deploy from the root index.html file we just created.

## Why This Works:
- No complex GitHub Actions required
- Uses the index.html in the root directory
- Simpler and more reliable for basic sites
- Still automatic - updates when you push changes

Your site will be live at: https://mostgood1.github.io/mlb-team-comparator/
